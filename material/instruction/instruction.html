<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p><em>Thank you for participating in the experiment. The aim of the experiment is to investigate how people play a piece of music expressively. The experiment is going to last about one hour.</em></p>
<p><em>If you have any questions or concerns, please ask the experimenter at any time about the nature of the study or the methods we are using. Also, you have the right to withdraw from the experiment at any time.</em></p>
<p><em>Before we start the experiment, please read the information sheet carefully and fill it out if you agree to take part in the study.</em></p>

<p><strong>Collect the informed consent form</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="warm-up-session">Warm-up session</h3>
<p><em>Now, you are going to play what you practised during the experiment. Before we start testing, I would like you to practise your favourite pieces / exercises so that you can get used to the digital piano. I am going to leave the room, so when you think that you can comfortably perform music with this piano, please let me know.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Experimenter should leave the room / Let participants practise their favourite pieces alone</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ask participants to choose one of the favourite tempi (100, 110, 120 bpm)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>In each beat, there should be two 8th notes! Please check participants understand the tempo correctly.</span></p>
<p><em>Please practise until you feel that you comfortably perform the piece without pitch errors. After practice, we will have a brief test to make sure you can perform the piece. Let me know when you are ready for the brief test.</em></p>

<li>Staccato: musical notes have shortened duration and are separated from each other</li>

<ol type="1">
<li>Check whether data were recorded correctly. If not, leave a memo on the checklist.</li>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>If participants ask whether they can use different fingerings, please let them know that they can play as they like.</li>
<li>If participants ask whether they should keep the tempo or not, please let them know that they can play as they like, but keep in mind the metronome tells you the original tempo of this piece.</li>
<li>If participants ask anything related to detailed information about each skill (e.g., deeper legato? normal/subito forte?), just ask them to play as they like.</li>
<li>If participants start playing before the metronome beats, please record the same trial again.</li>
</ul>
